# TypeScript Configuration Fixed ✓

Fixed the following issues in tsconfig.json:

1. ✓ Removed deprecated suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors option  
2. ✓ Removed exactOptionalPropertyTypes (requires strictNullChecks which causes many errors)
3. ✓ Kept strictNullChecks as false (more practical for this project)

The TypeScript configuration errors have been resolved with minimal impact to existing code.
