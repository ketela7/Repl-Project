# Google Drive Pro - Professional Drive Management

## Overview

Google Drive Pro is a professional-grade Google Drive management application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and modern React patterns. It provides enterprise-level file operations with an intuitive user interface for efficient document management. The application leverages Google Drive API for comprehensive file operations including bulk operations, advanced filtering, and collaborative features.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React server components
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 for Google OAuth integration
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled for comprehensive type checking

### Backend Architecture
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes with route handlers
- **Authentication**: Server-side session management with NextAuth.js
- **Google Integration**: googleapis library for Google Drive API operations
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Performance**: Request deduplication, throttling, and caching strategies

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration with drive scope permissions
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Protected route middleware for secure access
- Fallback handling for authentication failures

### Drive Management
- **File Operations**: Create, read, update, delete operations with bulk support
- **Folder Management**: Hierarchical folder navigation and operations
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search with multiple filter criteria
- **Drag & Drop**: Sortable file interface with @dnd-kit integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic updates with error rollback

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting with React.lazy
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for API responses (60-minute TTL)
- **Throttling**: API request throttling (25 requests/second)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and package optimization

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Responsive data tables with horizontal scrolling
- Safe area support for modern mobile devices

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates Google OAuth through NextAuth.js
2. Google redirects with authorization code
3. NextAuth exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
4. Tokens stored in session for API requests
5. Session validated on protected routes

### Drive Operations
1. UI components trigger operations through API routes
2. API routes authenticate using session tokens
3. GoogleDriveService handles API communication
4. Response cached and returned to client
5. UI updates optimistically with error handling

### Error Handling
1. Errors classified by type (network, auth, quota, etc.)
2. Retryable errors automatically retried with backoff
3. User-friendly error messages displayed
4. Fallback UI components for error states
