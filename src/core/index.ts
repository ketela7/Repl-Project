// TODO: Gradually move core services here from src/lib/
// This module will contain:
// - Configuration management
// - Core services (cache, retry, database)
// - Application middleware
// - Security utilities
// - Common types and constants

// For now, services remain in their current locations in src/lib/
// Future migration will consolidate them into this core structure
