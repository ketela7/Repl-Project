- Responsive button layouts

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Selection state
const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [isSelectMode, setIsSelectMode] = useState(false);

// Progress tracking
const [bulkOperationProgress, setBulkOperationProgress] = useState({
  isRunning: boolean;
  current: number;
  total: number;
  operation: string;
});
```

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for all operations
- Individual item failure tracking
- User-friendly error messages
- Operation rollback on critical failures
- Toast notifications for results

### Performance Optimizations
- Staggered API calls to prevent rate limiting
- Progressive UI updates during operations
- Memory-efficient selection management
- Optimized re-renders using React.useMemo

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly controls
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Consistent behavior across devices
- Accessible keyboard navigation

### Browser Support
- Modern browser compatibility
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Use bulk operations for efficiency when managing multiple items
2. Review selections before confirming destructive operations
3. Monitor progress for large operations
4. Check notifications for operation results

### Limitations
- Folder copying not supported by Google Drive API
- Download operations limited by browser capabilities
- Rate limiting may affect very large operations
- Network connectivity required for all operations

## Error Scenarios

### Common Issues
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with user notification
- **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **API Rate Limits**: Graceful handling with progress updates
- **Browser Limitations**: Fallback strategies for downloads

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Partial operation success tracking
- Clear indication of failed items
- Option to retry failed operations
- Preservation of selection state during errors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Batch rename operations
- Advanced filtering for bulk selection
- Operation queuing for large datasets
- Bulk permission management
- Export/import of selection sets

### Performance Improvements
- Background processing for large operations
- Optimistic UI updates
- Enhanced caching strategies
- WebWorker integration for heavy operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. The feature uses existing Google Drive API configuration.

### Dependencies
- Google Drive API v3
- React hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Radix UI for accessible components

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Selection functionality across both view modes
2. Operation cancellation and progress tracking
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Cross-browser compatibility
5. Mobile device functionality
6. Large dataset performance

### Validation
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility compliance testing
